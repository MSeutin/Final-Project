# Final Project Proposal 
by Michael and Anudari

## Description
- A game where the user maneuvers a vehicle (some moving object). 
- User will interact with its environment or challenges along the way.
- User either needs to avoid being hit by objects or shoot and destroy them to not lose.
- Our goal is to make use of shadows and perspective cameras, and figure out how to animate ground movement. 

## Schedule
- Week 1 - create the canvas view, and find some models
- Week 2 - import models and make sure they're visible under a perspective projection, figure out how to render shadows of objects onto the ground surface. 
- Week 3 - animate my objects, and improve shading, and figure out motion of the player and what he is interacting with.
- Week 4 - final polish, presentation prep
